Revision of Functions

Note : 

1) Python does not support function overloading it will always take recent defination.
2) We use the name kwargs with the double star. The reason is that the double star allows us to pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them).
3) A keyword argument is where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function.
4) Local variable: it is a variable which we are defining in the function and the scope will be in the function only.
5) Global variable: global variable is a variable which we are defining outside of the funciton and the scope will be global.
6) Lambda Function: There won't be any defination for lambda it is anonymous function.
7) Map Function : It Mapped the values in one variable. 
8) Fillter function : It filter the values according to the condition.
